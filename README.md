# global
Linux simple file installer in bash

This tool will give you the option to move executables into your prefered directory in $PATH with ease. 
It will also make it executable with chmod +x.

You can install global with global ;)
(move into the directory where global is locatet and [sudo chmod +x global] {if you want to do it for all users}, then [cp global global0] and start global0 to install global) ^^
